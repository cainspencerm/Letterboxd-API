# Letterboxd API

Java wrapper for Letterboxd's private API (https://letterboxd.com).

From Letterboxd:

  > The Letterboxd API provides access to data from the Letterboxd.com service.
  
  > Entities are identified in the API by Letterboxd ID (or LID), an alpha-numeric string value that is returned by the API where appropriate.

Letterboxd API in Java allows users to access Letterboxd's API with Java programs easier than blatant calls to the API. Authentication and data requests produce JSON entities, which are wrapped in simple Java objects such as FilmSummary or MemberSummary.
